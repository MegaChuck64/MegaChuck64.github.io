            &emsp; A 2-5D roguelike action, card-collecting game
            <br> made in Unity. It was made as my senior project
            <br> over a 25 week period. I made it with one other
            <br> programmer and two artists
            <br> &emsp; My main responsibilites included procedural
            <br> dungeon generation as well as handling the
            <br> structure of the card system.
