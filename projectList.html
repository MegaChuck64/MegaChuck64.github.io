            &emsp; A 2-5D roguelike action, card-collecting game
            <br> made in Unity. It was made as my senior project
            <br> over a 25 week period. I made it with one other
            <br> programmer and two artists
            <br>
            <br> &emsp; My main responsibilites included procedural
            <br> dungeon generation as well as handling the
            <br> structure of the card system.

            &emsp; Built in Unity using Perlin Noise,
            <br> this is a procedural generating island.
            <br> I start out with a a circle with a 
            <br> gradient going outwards from the center
            <br> mapping from 0-1. I then subtract each            
            <br> value by the values from a perlin noise
            <br> sample, along with some other little 
            <br> things to make it look prettier.
            <br>
            <br> &emsp; I've added features for you to
            <br> map different colors for elements on the
            <br> island (sand, rocks, dirt, etc.) based on 
            <br> ranges of those gradient perlin numbers.
            <br> I've also added the ability to save certain
            <br> islands which will be loaded when you come
            <br> back to this page.
